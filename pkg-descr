Cardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform
and home to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to
evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.

A stake pool is a reliable server node that holds and maintains the combined
stake of various stakeholders in a single entity. Stake pools use the Cardano
node to validate how the pool interacts with the network and are responsible
for transaction processing and block production.
